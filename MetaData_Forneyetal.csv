"For Snake River hatcheries, we used LGD to BON estimates from the Fish Passage Center, which are hatchery-specific (McCann et al. 2024, https://www.fpc.org/documents/CSS/2024%20CSS%20Final.pdf).",,
"For Upper Columbia hatcheries, we used MCN to BON annual estimates of in-river survival for hatchery fish generated by NOAA (Widner et al. 2023:  NOAA Contract Report NMFS-NWFSC-CR-2024-05, https://doi.org/10.25923/tn7y-6b23).",,
